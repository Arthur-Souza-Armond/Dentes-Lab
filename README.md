# App Java - Firebase CRUD

Application for dental laboratory management

At the beggining of 2021, I was purposed to create an application to manage a dental laboratory from Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

The requirements were:

- Mobile application for everybody in the enterprise can acess from anywhere
- Simple management
- Member Ã¡rea
- customer data
- agility in the process

What I have use to this project:

- Firebase
- Java Language
- API and thread consumption
- Android Studio

I accepted this project to learn more about the java language and get more familiar with web services, cloud database, No-sql and other features. OBS: When I made this application I was still very new in this world and I ended up not using some more suitable methodologies and such advanced programming to better consume my threads and speed up my processes.


I'll add some images below so you can see what the app layout looks like. There was still a lot to improve in terms of UI/UX designer, but it was good to learn more.
